Explore the principles and techniques behind computer-generated holography (CGH). Learn how to generate holograms computationally and visualize the holographic reconstruction process.
- Binary Search
- Simulated Annealing
- Complex Outputs

### Fourier Optics
- Motivated using FFT to transform signals to their constiuent frequencies
- Finding the irradiance patterns from an analytical solutions for a
1. 1-D Double
2. 1-D Single Slit
3. 2-D Double Slit

### Photon Statistics
Delved into the statistical nature of photons and explore concepts such as photon counting, photon correlation, and intensity fluctuations. Gained insights into the behavior of light at the quantum level.

### Waveguides
Study the behavior of light propagation in waveguides, such as optical fibers. Simulate waveguide structures, analyze their optical properties, and understand the principles underlying their functionality.
